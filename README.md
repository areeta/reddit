## Installation

Download:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Create an account on:
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

In order to connect the two, open the assistant window on Android Studio, add a Realtime database, and making sure your permission rules on edit and read are set to true on Firebase. To use the Assistant Window, you will need Google Repository v26 or higher downloaded in Android Studio.

## Usage

Press the green play button at the top of your left side on Android Studio. Check if the data is entered successfully on the Firebase website.
